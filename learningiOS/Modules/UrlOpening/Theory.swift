 SFSafariViewController
 SFSafariViewController is a class provided by Apple's SafariServices framework in iOS that allows developers to embed a Safari browser view within their iOS applications. This class provides a convenient way to display web content without leaving the app's environment. It's particularly useful for scenarios where you want to display web content but still maintain the look and feel of your app.

 Here are some key features and use cases for SFSafariViewController:

 1. Embedded Web Browsing: SFSafariViewController allows you to embed a fully functional Safari browser within your app. Users can browse the web, interact with web pages, and perform actions such as navigating back and forward, refreshing the page, and opening links.
 2. Native Integration: Unlike launching Safari externally, which switches the user out of your app, SFSafariViewController provides a seamless user experience by keeping the user within your app while they browse web content.
 3. UI Customization: While SFSafariViewController provides a default Safari-like user interface, you can customize certain aspects of its appearance to match your app's design. You can customize the color of the navigation bar, toolbar, and control buttons to integrate with your app's theme.
 4. Security and Privacy: SFSafariViewController provides built-in security features such as content blocking, which enables users to block unwanted content like ads and tracking scripts using content blocker extensions configured in Safari.
 5. Single Sign-On: SFSafariViewController shares cookies and website data with Safari, providing a seamless single sign-on experience for users who are already logged into websites in Safari.
